What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Ans: Both are used to integrate changes from one branch to another. Merging is useful for preserving branch history, 
especially on shared branches, but it can lead to a more complex history with merge commits. Whereas, rebasing is more 
suitable for creating a cleaner and linear history, however, it rewrites the commit history.
