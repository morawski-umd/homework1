What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

When a fork is made, there is a new branch created. This branch can hold files, but then has to be merged back into the master branch after verification
and completion. Rebasing is for making it look as though a branch was forked from a different commit than the main one or the one originally forked from. 
So the main difference between a merge and commit is that a merge adds files to the master branch, while a rebase updates the start of a branch to a
different commit than originally forked from.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a collaborative space for coding. Some people may have a local repository, but they can commit code they are trying to a share to
a remote repository so as to include the collaborative aspect. A remote repository has a history to it, which can be useful for the software development
process.
