What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

By definition git rebase is when you want to update the start of your branch to a later commit that happened after you branched out. 
And git merge is when you want to take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. 

So the difference between a merge and a rebase is that git merge is a way of combining changes from one branch (source branch) 
into another branch (target branch) where as git rebase is a way of moving the changes from one branch onto another branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a central online repository that is seen by several collaborators.
