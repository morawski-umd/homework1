What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge incorporates changes from named commits in the current branch onto the main branch.   
The changes are replayed from the new branch until its current commit is on top of the main branch.
The result of the merge is recorded on a new commit along with the names of the two branches and a
log message decribing the changes. 

A Rebase is a process where a sequence of commits is moved or combined with a new base commit. 
This effectively rewrites the project history by creating new commits for each commit in the main branch. 


Merging is a non-destructive operation as the exisiting branches are not changed in any way.
The effects on a project from rebasing are different from a merge in that rebasing does not allow you to see when upstream changes 
were incorporated into the new branch.
