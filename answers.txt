What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Git merge focuses on bringing the changes on one branch, or line of development, into another one. Typically this involves 
merging a seperate development branch into the main one. Rebasing is under the same idea of applying changes on one branch to
another, but there is difference. Git merge will apply changes to one branch (the target one), but the other branch (source) will remain the same.
For git rebase, we are not preserving the history of the other branch. Rather, we are taking the new changes in the source branch and add them into the target branch. This eliminates the previous commits of the source branch, and gives the main branch are more consolidated history of commits.
