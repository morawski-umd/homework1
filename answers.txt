What is a remote repository?

A remote repository in Git is a version control repository that is hosted on a server or a remote location, typically outside of your local development environment. Remote repositories serve as a centralized hub for collaborating with others on a software development project. They allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase, share changes, and synchronize their work.
