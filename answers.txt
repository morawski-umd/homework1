What is the difference between a merge and rebase?

In Git, merging and rebasing serve as mechanisms to integrate changes between branches, but they do so differently. 
Merging combines changes, preserving the individual branch histories, and creates a new merge commit. 
It is suitable for incorporating feature branches into the main branch while maintaining a clear chronology of changes in each branch. 
In contrast, rebasing reapplies commits from one branch onto another, rewriting the source branch's history to appear linear. 
This provides a cleaner, linear history but can make it harder to track when changes were initially made. Rebasing is useful for maintaining a streamlined commit history
and resolving conflicts before merging. The choice between the two depends on project requirements and workflow preferences.
