What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a centralized storage site for versioned code and project 
data that is often housed on a server or cloud-based platform. It allows several 
developers to collaborate by offering a shared, up-to-date version of the project's 
history and files, allowing contributors to submit changes and pull updates from the 
remote repository. Popular remote repository hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab 
have evolved into indispensable tools for software development, enabling effective cooperation and code management.
