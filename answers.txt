What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging creates a new merge commit to join the branches, preserving the parent commits. However, rebasing rewrites the commit history by placing the changes of one branch on top of another, creating a linear history with no merge commits.

What is a remote repository?
In git, a remote repo is a project/folder hosted on a server or another location outside of the local environment. Remote repositories allows collaboration and version control workflows.
