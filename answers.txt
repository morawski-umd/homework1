What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge is non-destructive, and askes for individual conflicts to be resolved as the current fork is incorporated into main.
A rebase on the other hand, essentially commits all those changes ontop of the main branch, which can be destructive, but gives a linear edit history.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is an online copy of your code base, that keeps track of version history, and allows for multiple people to work on it, and is
the basis of git.
