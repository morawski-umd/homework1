What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging preserves the original commit history, creates a new merge commit, and is suitable for collaborative workflows with less risk of conflicts. On the other hand, rebasing rewrites commit history to create a clean, linear history.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of the repository that serves as a central or shared repository that can be accessed and collaborated on by multiple developers.
