What is a remote repository?

A remote repository exists on the Internet, on sites like GitHub or BitBucket. It can be accessed or cloned by the members of a software development team. Sfotware developers will clone the remote repo on their machine (local repo), and push their changes to the remote repo as they develop their projects.
