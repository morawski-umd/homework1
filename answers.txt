What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of a project or a bookmark of a project that is stored on a remote computer.
A remote repository allows for several developers to make changes to their local repositories without affecting the remote or central repository
that is seen by all developers. Developers use the remote repository for pushing their individual changes to the remote and pulling the collective 
changes made by everyone on the remote to their local respository.
