What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge pushes code in the branch back to the parent branch, while a rebase restructures the start of the current branch, setting the start of it to a previous commit. 

What is a remote repository?
remote repositories are hosted on the internet, not locally. These can have multiple contributors/people working on them, allowing for collaboration.
