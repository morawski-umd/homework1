# Homework 1

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging in Git integrates changes from one branch into another by creating a new merge commit, showing when the merge occured, and preserving the original branch's history. Rebasing rewrites commit history by replaying changes from one branch on top of another which results in a linear history. It is useful in keeping a clean history but it alters commit hashes so should be used very carefully.
