What is a remote repository? 
A remote repository in Git is a centralized storage location separate from your local computer where project code and version history are stored. It facilitates collaboration among multiple developers by allowing them to share, synchronize, and work on the same codebase. Remote repositories are hosted on services like GitHub and provide a backup of the project's code, access control, and a platform for managing collaboration through features like pull requests and issue tracking.
